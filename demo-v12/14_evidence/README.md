## Permitted node types
- `evidence`

## Required fields
- `sourceType`
- `sourceRef`
- `citationStatus`
- `relevantClaim`
- `conclusionSeparate`

## Allowed incoming edges
- `supports/challenges -> 10_technical_canon or 13_hypothesis`

## Allowed outgoing edges
- `feedsInto -> papers/`

## Completion condition
Negative evidence, null results and replication status recorded alongside favorable evidence.

## Propagation behavior
Empirical failure flags dependents for review. Local unless the claim is empirical at root.

## NLP / classifier operations
Verify citations resolve. Separate source content from source conclusions.

## Validation rules
LLM and wiki summaries are NOT decisive evidence. They are baseline maps and belong in 22_lived_synthesis unless they point to inspectable sources.

## Public rendering
Evidence ledger, including what cuts against.
