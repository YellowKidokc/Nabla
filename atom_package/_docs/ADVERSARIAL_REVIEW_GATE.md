# Adversarial Review Gate

The gate sits between automatic relationship discovery and human acceptance.
It is intentionally asymmetric: an adversarial `oppose` verdict blocks a wire,
while `pass` and `uncertain` remain `awaiting_human`. The tool never edits an
atom and never promotes a proposal to accepted status.

## GUI

```bash
python _scripts/claim_beacon.py propose
python _scripts/adversarial_gui.py
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8787>. The GUI shows source and target nodes as a wire,
the deterministic match, the newest review receipt, and its gate state.

## CLI and automation

The offline reviewer is conservative and useful in hooks or scheduled jobs:

```bash
python _scripts/adversarial_review.py
python _scripts/adversarial_review.py --proposal-id cbp-example
```

It blocks explicit falsified/retracted/rejected/contradictory material. When it
cannot prove a contradiction, it reports uncertainty rather than manufacturing
a pass.

Any service exposing an OpenAI-compatible chat-completions API can supply the
adversarial model. This keeps the framework independent of a particular vendor
or orchestration tool (including n8n):

```bash
export ADVERSARY_API_URL=https://provider.example/v1/chat/completions
export ADVERSARY_MODEL=review-model
export ADVERSARY_API_KEY=secret
python _scripts/adversarial_review.py --provider compatible
```

For the GUI, configure only `ADVERSARY_API_KEY` in the server environment; the
endpoint and model are entered in the page. Keys are never returned to or
stored by the browser. n8n can either execute the CLI or POST JSON to
`/api/review` with `proposalID`, `provider`, `endpoint`, and `model`.

Receipts are written to `_proposals/adversarial-reviews.jsonl`, one latest
receipt per proposal. They assess only four categories, enough structure to
make decisions without pretending to encode all philosophy:

1. **Epistemology** — whether evidence bears the claimed confidence.
2. **Ontology** — whether the mapped entities/categories are commensurable.
3. **Logic** — whether direction, scope, and boundaries survive the mapping.
4. **Falsification** — whether kill conditions contradict or defeat the wire.

Operational rule: only a separate, authenticated human workflow may turn a
proposal into an accepted edge. It must refuse any proposal whose latest
receipt has `gateStatus: blocked`.

Definition-link proposals in `_proposals/definition-links.jsonl` pass through
this same reviewer. A resolver confidence score—even 0.99 for an explicit
marker—is discovery evidence, not acceptance. The reviewer can block a link;
otherwise it remains `awaiting_human`. Neither the resolver nor this gate may
edit an accepted edge or promote a candidate definition to canonical.

## Math translations

Claims with `mathematicalForm` or `mathFormNormal` can be converted into
reviewable everyday translation nodes:

```bash
python _scripts/math_translation.py --claim-id tp:test/C1
python _scripts/math_translation.py --claim-id tp:test/C1 --write
```

Generated translation nodes are always `status: proposed` with an unreviewed
generation receipt. They explain structure; they do not solve the equation,
add theological conclusions, or promote the source claim.
